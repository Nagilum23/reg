reg - maintain www.freshports.org subscriprions

This script will automatically subscribe you to all the ports you have installed and
unsubscribe you from any ports you don't have installed.

There are two versions of the script. One for the old system and one for pkgng.
Username and password need to be changed directly in the script. Since I made these just for myself 
I was too lazy to create a configfile.
